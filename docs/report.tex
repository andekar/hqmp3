    This project aims to show how one can parse and decode binary formats in
    Haskell, showcased by implementing an mp3 decoder.

\section{Motivation}
    Det Ã¤r ju najs med en mp3-decoder i Haskell

\section{Background}
    Hej
    \subsection{The MP3 format}
       The MP3 format is probably the most well-known and widespread format for
       encoding audio. It was engineered by the MPEG group as part of the MPEG-1
       standard ISO-11172 which was published in 1993. As part of this standard,
       the document describing MP3 is ISO-11172-3 \cite{wikimp3,wikimpeg1}.

       MP3 is a lossy format *describe me*.

       The data in an mp3 file is divided into frames. Each frame consists of
       a header, side info, and audio data. *describe me*

\section{Implementation}
    \subsection{bitstring}
        Probably the best library I have ever seen
    \subsection{huffman}
        Probably the most unneccessary library I have ever written. Remove?

\section{Results}
    Beauty, Slowness\ldots
